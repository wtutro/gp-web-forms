Maven based project generated from maven archetype for Liferay version 6.2.4.

Please keep in mind that some of the classes during developing of a production portlet (not just a 'coding task') should be moved to common library outside current portlet, ex.:
 - BaseController
 - Utils classes
 - Constants classes
 - etc.

Maven additional plugins used:
- jgitflow: https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/jgit-flow/wiki/Home - plugin for maven to use git branching model called gitflow: http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/
